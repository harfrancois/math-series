# Lab: Class 02 - Modules and Testing
### Harvey Francois

## Overview
The Fibonacci Series is a numeric series starting with the integers 0 and 1. In this series, the next integer is 
determined by summing the previous two.

The Lucas Numbers are a related series of integers that start with the values 2 and 1 rather than 0 and 1. 

### Feature Tasks
Create a function called fibonacci. The function should have one parameter n. The function should return the nth value
in the fibonacci series. You may implement the function using recursion or iteration. If you are feeling particularly 
frisky, do both as separate functions.

In your series.py module, add a new function lucas that returns the nth value in the lucas numbers Again, you may use 
recursion or iteration, or both. Again, ensure that your function has a well-formed docstring.

Both the fibonacci series and the lucas numbers are based on an identical formula. Add a third function called 
sum_series with one required parameter and two optional parameters. The required parameter will determine which 
element in the series to print. The two optional parameters will have default values of 0 and 1 and will determine 
the first two values for the series to be produced.
